# SussyJailEngine-2
A new version of the sussyjail engine coded from scratch

## How to use
To run a map in sussyJail-2 you must type the folowing into the console  
`py main.py <map_folder_name>`
This will load the map and you will be able to play it. Maps made using the old editor  
may have an empty line att the end of each objects config file, to run them in SussyJail-2 you  
will need to remove this.
